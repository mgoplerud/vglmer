# vglmer: Variational Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Regression

A package to estimate non-linear hierarchical models using the variational algorithms described in XX. It also provides the option to improve an initial approximation using marginally augmented variational Bayes (MAVB) also described in XX.

At present, it can be fit on logistic and negative binomial outcomes with an arbitrary number of random effects.
