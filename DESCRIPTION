Description: This package includes methods for estimating non-linear hierarchical models using mean-field variational Bayes. At present, it can estimate logistic, linear, and negative binomial models. It can accommodate models with an arbitrary number of random effects and requires no integration to solve. It also provides the ability to improve the quality of the approximation using marginal augmentation. Goplerud (2022) <doi:10.1214/21-BA1266> provides details on the variational algorithms.
